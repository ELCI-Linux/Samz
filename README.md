# Samz
Samz is a simple bash script that allows users to install a range of finance applications for Linux - via a Graphical User Interface. 
Designed primarily for Debian based systems (with some Red Hat support), Samz takes the hassle out of installing finance applications using bash-script automation. Users simply choose the software they would like and the method of installing the software and Samz does the rest.

**Messages for the Community**
ARCH USERS (We Need You!):
  We understand that the arch community is huge and massively important part of the modern Linux community, and we would like to include Arch support for           future versions of Samz. 

Samz is currently being developed and maintained by a single individual, however we are open to credited collaboration with any other Linux users within the space.
